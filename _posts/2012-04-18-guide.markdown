# 如何辦活動教學

## 舉辦首場 Rails Girls 活動

我們的宗旨是賦予女性理解技術的工具。Rails Girls 活動對於每個想打造網路世界的人都是一次絕佳的體驗。

Rails Girls 於 2010 年底在赫爾辛基成立。本來只是個一次性的活動，從未想到世界各地會出現有這麼多的分部！本教學把所有資源集結起來，來幫助妳舉辦首場活動。

如果想辦場活動，從填寫 [http://railsgirls.com/inyourcity](http://railsgirls.com/inyourcity) 開始，我們的人將會聯絡妳。

未來將舉辦的活動可以在這裡找到 [www.railsgirls.com](http://railsgirls.com)。

### 基礎

Rails Girls 活動是非盈利性的。我們不跟參加者收費，也不會支付報酬給教練或是講師。參加者不需要有任何的程式知識，也沒有年齡限制。只要有台筆電和一點好奇心就可參加！

為期兩天的活動包含了大量的小組協作及一些簡短的演講，重點介紹編程、設計、以及 web。不會有八股的辯論或是演講 ─ Rails Girls 的精神是務實與隨和。抽象的概念越少越好，實踐精神越多越好。

#### Rails Girls 哲學

* 讓人格特質散發光彩，將遠景銘記在心。反覆解釋一個觀念時，記得將觀念與大環境放在一起看。

* 網路是人打造出來的，不會因為你的牛刀小試而崩壞。要一直展現人性的一面：鼓勵教練討論開源社群、偶像以及啟發他們的故事。

* 複製貼上是王道！寫程式不是最重要的 ─ 一天不可能學的會中文，用同樣的角度看，妳只能學會在程式領域裡，如何表達想法以及一些基本的術語。活動的目標是能有馬上能看到的成效展現給學員。

* 世界因女孩而精采！但女人、女士甚至是男孩們都可以參與進來。這裡的“女孩”不僅限於語義上的女孩，是指一種心態。Rails Girls 的兩位創辦人都是聽著辣妹合唱團的歌長大的，女孩不是指可愛的小女生，或是有負面涵意，而是指一種對世界充滿好奇的心態。

### 範例議程

每場 Rails Girls 活動由一場“安裝節慶”開始，將活動所需的環境安裝在女孩們的電腦上。 這裡有準備好的[教學指南](/install)。安裝節慶可以包含簡短的演講，但重點是給女孩提供氣泡酒，將隔天活動所需的一切準備好，讓女孩們互相認識。時間應該是可以靈活調整的 ─ 你知道該怎樣分配時間，對參與者最好。我們有在週末與工作日辦過活動的經驗。連續兩個晚上（下午四點至晚上十點），這可能會更符合你的需求。

#### 工作坊的教學目標

* 理解靜態與動態網頁的差別。

* web 世界的術語：讓學員了解網路應用需要什麼基本元素有個簡單的了解。編程的術語：字串、方法、變數、陣列、破壞性方法、鏈鎖、雜湊、符號、區塊等等。以及認識工具（像是終端機、瀏覽器、文字編輯器）。對打造網路的積木有個概念性的理解：程式語言、網路框架、資料庫、基礎設施。

* 讓學員有個概念，不管是在有網路，還是沒網路的情況下，如何在程式的世界裡持續學習。

#### 週五夜晚：安裝

19:00 - 21:00 安裝與互相認識

*提示*：設立一個教練桌，讓有安裝問題的學員來問問題。
有些安裝可能會失敗：遇到這種情況，讓女孩跟別人一起學習，不要在安裝上浪費太多時間。

會場用氣球與海報佈置。在活動上放一些有趣的[音樂](http://open.spotify.com/user/lindaliukas/playlist/1fgkUFCFDrSn621kf4iHhr)。

想一些活動來打破尷尬：比如讓女孩在便利貼寫下為什麼來參加活動，或是畫她們夢想中的 web 應用。

記得要來個 [Friday 抱抱](http://fridayhug.com)！

九點 -> 教練晚餐

教練們可以一起溫習第二天要講解的應用。

#### 禮拜六：工作坊

09:00 - 10:00 註冊與咖啡時光

*提示* 預留足夠的時間讓大家混熟，並為昨天仍有安裝問題的學員解決問題。分發講義，蒐集 Bentobox 練習會用到的技術詞縮寫。

10:00 - 10:10 歡迎致詞

*提示* 提一下贊助商，展示即將打造的 web 應用，簡單介紹寫程式是怎麼一回事。

10:30 - 11:00 用戶體驗 (UX)工作坊

11:00 - 11:30 編程簡介

*提示* 請一位教練講解寫程式。並解釋為什麼用 Rails 要懂點基本的 Ruby。

主題應包含：

* 靜態與動態網站的差別：什麼是 web app？

* 程式語言是什麼？什麼是 Rails？

* 會用到的工具：瀏覽器、終端、程式碼編輯器、目錄結構。

展示並介紹 [TryRuby](http://tryruby.org)，一起做 3-4 個練習。


11:30 - 13:00 工作坊時間

慢慢的走一遍 [Rails Girls 教學 APP](/app)。記得停下來解釋你在做什麼，以及重要的觀念。試著簡單的解釋觀念，即便是犧牲了準確性。不需要討論高深的概念。試著回答她們的問題，當問題過於艱澀或超出範圍時，應直接跳過。不是要教她們完美的編程技巧，而是讓她們看看事情是如何完成的。先打造 web app 出來，接著才想怎麼做好。

概念應包含：

+ Rails Generators
+ Scaffolds: Rails App Structure
+ Gem Management
+ MVC, REST/Resources
+ Models and Active Record
+ Controllers and ActionController
+ Views and ERB

*小貼士：*

教練也是人。他們也是第一次當教練。教學對他們來說可能很難或是怯場，記得要在不同情況下，比如教練有困難時，即時幫助他們，即便只是鼓勵與支持。

13:00 - 14:00 午餐時光

14:00 - 14:30 Bentobox 練習

將技術性的術語放在一個叫做 Bentobox 概念性的模型的語境裡。

兩個練習：一、用實際的 Bentobox 板子來講解 10 個技術觀念。二、過一下女孩交給教練的名詞。

+ [Bentobox 投影片](http://speakerdeck.com/u/railsgirls/p/rails-girls-bentobox-exercise)
+ [教學影片](http://vimeo.com/39049632)

14:30 - 18:00 工作坊時間

到了繼續開發應用的時間了。注意氣氛：當大家無法集中注意力的話，讓教練或講師講個快速的閃電秀。

閃電秀的範例講題：

+ （女性）職業程式設計師講講她在這個行業裡的體會。

+ 設計：UX 與 UI。用紙或電腦一起畫個 mockup。

+ 用有趣的方式來解釋技術觀念，或是熱門的框架：用 80 年代的經典老歌解釋 CoffeeScript？你心目中的 GitHub？編程與寫作有什麼共通點？

+ 展示一些實際的東西：不要講抽象的事情，具體點，講一些真實的故事。

當所有人都完成她們的 app 時，是時候透過修改 CSS 來擴充應用了或是加入評論系統等等。

19:00 After party

*提示：*
邀請所有人，包括當地的開發者、男孩子們、以及沒被錄取的參與者來參加！

#### 資料

+ [下載資料](http://www.speakerdeck.com/u/railsgirls)

### 推廣 Rails Girls

每個 Rails Girls 活動都會在 railsgirls.com/city 得到一個專屬的頁面，用來記錄與蒐集資訊。過去主辦過的城市請參考 [railsgirls.com/events](http://railsgirls.com/events)

妳也可以設定自己的 Facebook 以及 Twitter 專頁（記得把連結加到 workshop 頁面！）或是其它在你們當地很紅的服務。

You can also set up your own Facebook and Twitter page (remember to add links to your workshop's page!) or whatever service is popular in your community. Promoting the event through social media can go a long way these days, but make sure you have somebody to take care of the chosen channels. Some tips:

* Keep the tone of posts friendly, positive and welcoming. Be direct in inviting fans/followers to share the event with their friends.
* Photos are especially powerful messengers. Create your own graphics (*some ideas: "I'm a Rails Girl" Facebook cover for the event, word cloud with first names of women who signed up, an infographic of applications*) or promote photos from other workshops if this is your event. Follow other Rails Girls pages and account to get ideas for content and pass it along to your community.
* Try various pitches for events to attract different types of women; some will be in it for the fun and meeting new people, some to learn new things, some will be fueled by the desire to show guys that women can do anything. No need to focus on just one group!
* Don't be afraid to publicly thank women, coaches, blogs, media and other supporters who help you spread the word about your workshop for their support.
* If your language supports it, use feminine forms when addressing women.

While the event is underway, remember to take pictures, collect tweets and ask questions of the participants. You'll be thankful for all of that for your next event. We love to write blog posts about the speaker and participant experiences. A list of the coaches is also required.

+ [Download materials](http://www.speakerdeck.com/u/railsgirls)

#### 網站

寄 E-mail 到 contact(a)railsgirls.com 並要求把你的分部加入 repo。看看 README.txt 了解更多細節！在成立網站之前，應該至少有兩個教練及一個掛名贊助商。

+ [Counter for the site] (https://github.com/ys/rails-girls-count#readme)

#### 去哪找當地的開發者？

* Google 啊！幾乎每個國家都有某種類型的 Rails 或 Ruby 社群（有時候叫做 Ruby Brigage 或 Ruby Tuesday）。找找看 [Hacker News]() 的聚會、[GitHub](http://www.github.com) 貢獻者或 [Dribbble](http://dribbble) 起草人。找到當地的開源社群。逛逛看技術性的會議（這裡有個主題是 Ruby 的[清單](http://rubythere.com/)），以及 [meetup.com]() 上的 meetups。打給軟體開發公司，大家小家都可以。別忘了還有 IRC 跟 podcasts。

* 在 [Twitter search](https://twitter.com/#!/search-home) 上搜看看 `#rails` 或是 `#ruby` 以及 `#開源` 等 hashtag。比如要找到住紐約，附近 15 英哩的人，可以用這樣搜索看看 "near:NYC within:15mi"。某些國家有特別的 hashtags 像是 `#Rubysur` 或 `#RubyArg`，問問看便知道。

* 創業社群。辦活動、找社群？Startup Digest 是一個好的開始。

* 通常會有一兩個關鍵人物能幫你引薦，技術的世界其實小的不得了。

#### 去哪找參加者？

* Use social media: Facebook, Twitter & local networks such as Weibo. Friends, girlfriends, co-workers!

* Local [Girls in Tech](https://twitter.com/#!/gitweet), [DevChix](http://www.devchix.com/), [Geek Girl](http://geekgirlmeetup.com/) chapters etc. Check out also [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/). Twitter lists like @anitaborg's [Tech Women Programs](https://twitter.com/#!/anitaborg_org/tech-women-programs) and similar.

* Think outside the box: universities, book clubs, music stores, design agencies, [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com). We want women who are interested in technology, but they can still have very varied backgrounds.

#### 如何獲得媒體關注？

One of the big aims of Rails Girls is to make it more mainstream for women to build the web. That’s why we like to engage the local press and highlight the participants and their enthusiasm. We’d be happy to help prepare a press-release for the media. Check out [railsgirls.com/press](http://railsgirls.com/press) for more. If you're working with a big company as a sponsor, their PR department might be able to help you spread the message about the workshop.

Send the press release to local blogs, find contact at various media outlets. The more doors you knock on, the greater you chance of getting through. Make a list of journalists and bloggers you contact, mark those that respond to your emails, so they can be the first ones to receive your next press release. You can also write a press release after the event that includes photos and statements from satisfied participants.

### 贊助

Rails Girls talks to a demographic that might be hard to reach other ways: women who have an interest in technology, who are possible users, employees or partners of the sponsoring company.

We are looking for sponsors who are active participants in the local technology scene, whether it’s a startup or a big corporation, a non-profit or a government organization.

Also non-traditional technology companies can be approached: kids stores, universities, women's magazines, beverage brands etc. They all should however have some affiliation or interest in technology.

Rails Girls should always be kept non-profit: if there's money left, it should be used to support the future activities of the attendees. Don’t forget that you don’t need that much funding and even a two-person startup could be very willing to chip in.

### 給贊助商的書信範例

Dear xxx,

We are organizing a Rails Girls programming workshop in (insert city) on (insert dates).

Rails Girls is a two-day non-profit event for women of all ages to give them a great first experience in software craftmanship. We aim to give the tools to understand technology along with the community and inspiration to get started.

Rails Girls is not just about programming, it’s about building things. During the workshop, we’ll build an application and also have inspiring lightning talks and exercises.

For a closer look, please see www.railsgirls.com for past events and coverage.Here’s also a short video on the Berlin event held in April 2012: [http://vimeo.com/40852182](http://vimeo.com/40852182)

We are now looking for sponsors to help us realize this all.
We’d love to have your support!

Yours, name

### 大約要花多少錢？

The costs below are estimated for 30 participants, 10 coaches - but they may vary a lot. It's easiest to try to get a local sponsor to pay the bills directly or partner with someone who has a set account to handle money. These calculations are done in Finland, in €, where food & alcohol is very expensive, but spaces are often free. All in all you should be able to organise an event easily for a little over a thousand euros.

+ **Sparkling wine + cups** for the installation festival. 6 bottles, 6 euros a bottle. 36 euros.

+ **Breakfast Coffee**, pastry. 40 times around 5 euros. 200 euros

+ **Lunch.** Catered lunch can be around 15 euros, but you can do with a lot less by cooking yourself.  Add some water and coffee (50 euros). 650 euros.

+ **Marketing materials.** Printing workbooks, ordering stickers, posters and other swag. Again, varies a lot, maybe you can use someones printer, but at least around 200 should be reserved.

+ **Coach dinner.** At a restaurant or homemade. A way to say thank you to the coaches for their volunteer work. Around 20 euros per head. 200 euros.

+ **Space.** Try to get this one sponsored/free, they can be really expensive. Often startups are co-operative and can offer their space for use (esp. on weekends).	0 - XXXX euros.

+ **Afterparty.** It's nice if you can throw a good party with free beverages, but can also be done low-key in a local bar or on set/ in the park!	0 - XXXX euros.

+ **Travel expenses.**	If you don't have any RG-team members in your country, consider inviting us over. We don't need fancy hotels, promise! Same if you want to invite speakers to your event. 	0 - XXX

+ *總計 1286 歐元*.

__贊助商可以獲得什麼？__

* 活動網站上擺放 Logo
* Table space at event, opportunity to distribute handouts and/or swag
* A chance to speak to attendees for 5 minutes
* In most events there are official pictures taken that the sponsors can use afterwards

Don’t give out the participant info, but sponsors are free to hang out at the event and be sure to include a short message to the sponsor in a thank-you note. Sponsor swag may be included in the goodie bag to an extent, but it should be something tasteful, not trashy and/or related to women.

## 常見問題

#### 誰可以舉辦 Rails Girls 工作坊？


任何人。我們在找的是一群這樣的人，花心思讓女性第一次進入網路世界，就留下美好的初體驗。我們想看到的是擁有如下特質的人（不用全都滿足）：

* 熟悉當地開發者社群。不分技術，所以不用是純 Ruby 或 Rails 開發者。實際上每個活動需要 5 位（或更多，取決於妳要收多少學員），具有 Rails 基本知識的教練，貢獻兩天時間時間投入活動。每次活動大約是 25 - 40 人。
* 了解如何舉辦活動的人。不用非常厲害，但至少有點經驗。
* 對於如何找到對技術感興趣女性的人有想法的人。我們找的是對科技感興趣的女性，不管大學學的是文學、還是藝術、或是體育，都可以，我們要找的是沒有寫程式經驗，但對技術感興趣的人。
* 未來當女性碰到問題，或是想舉辦她們的活動、找到當地開發者聚會時，願意指點她們的人。

你是這樣的人嗎？從填寫這個表格開始：[http://railsgirls.com/inyourcity](http://railsgirls.com/inyourcity)，我們的人將會聯絡你。

#### 哪裡可以找到海報、名牌、投影片等等資料？

下面這個連結，有缺什麼請告訴我們！

+ [下載素材](http://www.speakerdeck.com/u/railsgirls)

#### 怎樣的場地合適？

We recommend choosing a venue with a built-in infrastructure for around 30-50 persons. For a programming event, this means:
* High-speed, tested Internet. There’s going to be over 30 computers online all the time. Add to that mobilephones, streaming music, funny videos and you get the picture!
* Space for 4-6 person groups to gather together: chairs and tables, sometimes big pillows will do! This doesn’t have to be in the same room.
* Possibility to set up extension chords and a projector.
* Enough electric outlets to spare. Some women might have older laptops that will need to be plugged in at all times.
* Location for food and beverage setup - lunch space for catering or a nearby lunch venue.
* External monitors for teams are encouraged but not mandatory, helps the coaches show what is happening in the code.
* Whiteboards can be helpful for coaches to explain more abstract concept. Alternatively, paper and pen work just fine. Just have something at hand people can draw on.

Ask where local developer meetings are usually hosted. Often co-working spaces are also willing to negotiate deals to gain some visibility among new people.

#### 教練需要具備什麼？

Rails Girls events are organized around small groups, maximum of 4-5 persons per one coach. If possible, try to have groups of 3 women for each coach. For instance, if you're doing an event for 30 women, aim for having 10 coaches (a few more for backup don't hurt). We know this isn't always possible, but do try not to have groups of more than 5 women, so the coach can still answer all questions in the group.

The coaches don’t need to be hardcore experts on Rails - basic knowledge and willingness to explain trumps expertise. So, if your local Rails community isn't very strong, do expand your search. You can have a mix of Rails experts and people with web development expertise in other frameworks. We are looking for people who like answering questions and can keep an upbeat and positive atmosphere through a period of 8 hours!

You can get to know the curriculum by checking out [guides.railsgirls.com/app](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app). There is also always a pre-event coach dinner where we’ll go through some pedagogical suggestions and check everyone knows what is happening. Avoid jargon, tie examples to what your doing, encourage asking questions. The installation instructions can be found at [guides.railsgirls.com/install](http://guides.railsgirls.com/install). We also understand that coaches are human and that for most of the people this is the first time teaching something. Worry not - the women have always been really happy with whatever they learn and just the chance to ask questions is enough.

We hope the coaches are ok with having their name and twitter-id/github/some mean of contact on railsgirls.com so the women always have a local face to answer their questions.

In addition, we encourage coaches to come up with additional exercises for the group. After completing the ideation app many women will want to try tweaking the look & feel of the site, implementing commenting, Facebook sharing, pushing the app to Heroku, etc.

#### 去哪找教練？

Ask around, ask sponsors (tech companies), ask anyone to help you out. Once you do get some coaches on board, they can help you out with their own contacts. Influential bloggers or Twitter users in your local dev community can help you out by broadcasting a call for coaches. *Hint: You can also thank coaches for their help by providing a spot at the workshop for their girlfriends ;)*

##### 給潛在教練的信件範本

"Dear community member,

We wish to invite you to take part in the Rails Girls event on (insert date). The event is aimed for women of all ages with no previous programming experience, but a lot of passion to building things. Rails Girls is an international non-profit, volunteer-based workshop. We've had events in Shanghai, Berlin, Helsinki, and Singapore. We expect to receive around a 100 applications.

In addition to giving a safe and fun first experience to coding for the women we want to engage them with local developers, open source, and the startup scene. We've attached some information on what coaching requires in practice. In addition, we have room for small lightning talks on technical subjects. If you have something you'd like to speak about, let us know.

For more information about the non-profit event, check railsgirls.com or guides.railsgirls.com

(You can also include the chapter "What is expected from the coaches" to the mail)"

#### 我會獲得什麼素材？

每個 Rails Girls 活動獲得一個專屬的網頁。

除此之外，我們會幫妳設計禮包、海報樣板、工作書及其他東西像是貼紙啦、反光貼紙等。所有的素材都可以在這個網站上找到。也可以詢問贊助商是否有意願要贊助什麼物品。我們一向歡迎有創意的 Rails Girls 分部，如果你有想法的話，告訴我們吧！

目前為止，我們有

* 貼紙
* 反光貼紙
* 刺青

同時看看這個

+ [下載素材](http://www.speakerdeck.com/u/railsgirls)

#### How do I choose attendees?

In the form we ask only two questions: do you have any previous background in coding and why would you be a good participant for Rails Girls

Rails Girls is intended for anyone and we want to keep it flexible enough for learners any age. However, make clear to the attendees what to expect: Rails Girls won’t make anyone into a coder, so people looking for i.e career change will be disappointed. On the other hand we like people with very diverse backgrounds and loads of enthusiasm.

After selecting participants we generally split them into three groups:

1. people with no previous programming experience
2. people with some front-end experience (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and
3. people with a little experience in programming or a background in computer sciences. You can use the different name-tags for each group if you want to (rubies, foxes, octocats, rails..)

##### Sample letter of acceptance

Title: Rails Girls workshop - welcome!

Dear attendee,

Congratulations! We’re happy to invite you to join in on the  Rails Girls workshop in (insert city). We hope that this workshop will provide you a great first experience on building web apps.

What happens next?

(Insert date for installation fest) starts at (insert time) with an installation fest - so please bring your laptop with you! You should also try to pre-install Rails with instructions from <http://guides.railsgirls.com/install/>

We will hold the event in (insert address)

On (insert date) we’ll dive into development. We’ll work in small groups with four to six person teams. Your team members will have about the same experience level as you. We'll be all developing a simple listing application. We'll wrap the day around (insert time). There's also going to be an evening party.

We have a lot of people wanting to get to the class, so if you can’t make it this time, let us know as soon as possible!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. We'll also be updating the website at (insert address)!

Best,

(Signature)

##### 拒絕信範本

Title: Rails Girls - not accepted this time

Dear applicant,

Unfortunately we couldn’t fit you in the workshop this time. To be able to give personal guidance to each participant, we could only take a fraction of the applicants. This time we prioritized women with no previous programming experience.

However, you're warmly welcome to the official afterparty. (Insert details).

We'll also be most likely organizing more events in your city. Follow twitter.com/railsgirls or facebook.com/railsgirls for more information.

There's always cancellations and we fill all available places, so we might still be taking in a couple of people!

Best,

(Signature)

##### 參加者感謝信範本

Dear Rails Girls,

Thank you for taking part in the Rails Girls event. We truly felt lucky to have such a talented & enthusiastic crowd of people with us and hope many of you will continue working with Rails in the future - you have the tools, now build something cool!

(Say a few words about the sponsors and coaches - thank you for the community)

Three things we want to share:

Workshop Materials
(Almost all) materials can be found in the guides section at http://guides.railsgirls.com. You can find presentations, materials and instructions from the workshop. If you took pictures or blogged about the event - let us know! We'll be publishing regularly on blog.railsgirls.com

Make Rails Girls better - give us feedback!
We want to hear from you! Give us feedback about the workshop or how we can make the event better – it’s really quick, and it’ll help us improve our workshop at railsgirls.com/feedback

Keep on coding!
We realize there was quite a lot of stuff in todays lecture and for most of you it all felt a little overwhelming. We strongly recommend trying out Rails for Zombies exercise at http://www.codeschool.com/ latest by next weekend, it'll refreshen all you've learned so far and teach you some more.

Two things to keep you going:
- (Insert here a couple of community events that the participants should take part in)

There was a LOT of interest in doing follow-up events. If you have ideas for this or want to volunteer for the organizing team, let us know and sign up for the group e-mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/rails-girls-team!

And thats all for now,
Your Rails Girls team

#### 活動結束後呢？

邀請真正的開發者來當 Rails Girls 的教練不僅給參與者一個做中學的機會，也降低了進入技術世界的門檻。但如何讓她們繼續寫程式呢？

* 鼓勵她們繼續練習，像是 Codecademy 或其它線上學習網站。
* 提兩個最近會舉辦，教練會去參加的活動。試著讓女性參加真正的開發者聚會。
* 邀請每個人加入 Facebook 小組，讓她們有地方可以問問題。
* 一個月之內再次邀請參加者聚會一次。可以在 Rails Girls 全球聚會頁舉辦這些活動 <http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls/>，我們會很開心地替你推廣活動。用什麼名義繼續聚會不重要，重點是大家出來聚會。
