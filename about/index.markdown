title: "Rails Girls 正體中文"
---

<strong>Inspired by Rails Girls Japan.</strong>

This site has a Traditional Chinese version of [Rails Girls Guide](http://guides.railsgirls.com/). <br/>
We created this site since we need Traditional Chinese documents for Taiwanese girls to get started.
In general, Taiwanese people don't read nor speak English. The Traditional Chinese version will cut down
obstacles for girls to get in to a technology world.
<br/>
Also, we have a blog site (mostly written in Traditional Chinese) [here](/blog/) to write
about Rails Girls events in Taiwan.
